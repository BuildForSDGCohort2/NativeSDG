## Telemedicine app with Dhis2 iot integration

Newer technologies, such as mobile applications on devices, allows for a wider breadth of telehealth possibilities. In this project the goal is to remotely monitor patient’s temperature and heart rate for chronically ill patients, the elderly, the handicapped and in the case of Covid-19 diagnosis. The system uses remote sensors (i.e temperature and heart rate) that will transmit data over the internet through and microcontroller with embedded ESP8266-ESP32 Wi-Fi Module to the DHIS2 cloud server for analysis, review and emergency treatment. The mobile application will also be available to the patients so they will check their trends and receive notifications in acute conditions in real-time. The doctor or healthcare provider will also receive notifications in real-time and can also view patients’ trends over a period using DHIS2 Dashboards (Data Visualization).
